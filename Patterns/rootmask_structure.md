# RootMask / RootFace · Nopal Lattice  
Commons Blueprint v1.0

## Purpose
A lightweight, breathable mask inspired by the inner skeleton of a nopal cactus.  
It offers shade, warmth, and a sense of shelter without blocking vision or breath.

## Materials
- Soft felt, cotton, linen, or similar cloth
- Thin strips of fabric or cord for “root lines”
- Soft ties or elastic for attachment
- Needle, thread, scissors

## Pattern
1. **Mask shape**  
   - Cut a gentle oval that sits from mid-forehead to mid-cheek.  
   - Leave a large, comfortable eye opening.  
   - The mask should not cover the mouth or nose completely.

2. **Root lattice**  
   - From a point between the eyebrows, sketch curved lines fanning outward,  
     like roots or leaf veins.  
   - Aim for 5–9 lines, organic rather than perfectly straight.

3. **Attach root lines**  
   - Sew thin strips or cord along these lines.  
   - The lattice should feel like a soft web holding the mask together.

4. **Straps**  
   - Attach soft straps or elastic at the temples.  
   - Fit should be snug but easy to remove.

## Use
- Quiet time, Mudhead play, story work  
- Sensory regulation for children who like a “den” or “inside” feeling

## Principle
RootMask should help the wearer feel rooted and sheltered,  
never confined or silenced.
