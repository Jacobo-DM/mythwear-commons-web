PART A — ANKLE BAND

1. Measure + Cut:
   - Measure around the narrowest part above the ankle bone.
   - Cut a strip:
     • Length = ankle circumference minus a little for stretch
     • Width = 4–6 cm (1.5–2.5 inches)

2. Form the Band:
   - Sew short ends together to form a loop, or
   - Leave as a wrap closure with ties.
   - Place seam or closure at the outer ankle, not directly over bone.

3. Grounding Markers:
   - Add small stitches or symbols at:
     • Inner ankle (balance / stillness point)
     • Outer ankle (direction / action point)
   - Optionally, connect them with a subtle curve that suggests a spiral around the leg.

PART B — SIMPLE TABI-STYLE FOOT BAND

1. Base Band:
   - Cut a strip long enough to wrap under the arch and over the top of the foot.
   - Width: 3–5 cm (1–2 inches).
   - Option: make two bands per foot: one closer to toes, one near midfoot.

2. Split-Toe Suggestion (Optional):
