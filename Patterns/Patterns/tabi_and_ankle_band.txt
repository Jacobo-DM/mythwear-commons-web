TABI AND ANKLE BAND PATTERN — GROUNDING FEET
Commons Blueprint v1.0

PURPOSE:
Simple, soft foot and ankle supports inspired by tabi.
Designed for grounding, balance, and quiet movement, especially in Rage Dance
and other mindful practices.

INTENT:
- Help the wearer feel their connection to the ground.
- Encourage lighter, quieter steps.
- Offer gentle awareness at the ankle without restricting movement.

MATERIALS:
- Soft but durable fabric (cotton, jersey, linen, reclaimed cloth)
- Optional thin sole layer (rubberized fabric or second cloth layer)
- Thread and needle
- Optional: elastic or ties for securing

PART A — TABI FOOT WRAP

1. FOOTSHELL SHAPE:
   - Cut a sole piece shaped like the wearer’s foot.
   - Cut an upper piece that:
     * wraps over the top of the foot,
     * splits between big toe and other toes,
     * leaves heel fairly open for ventilation.

2. CONSTRUCTION:
   - Sew the upper piece to the sole around the sides and front.
   - Leave enough space for toes to spread.
   - Reinforce the area between big toe and second toe.

3. CLOSURE:
   - Use simple ties, elastic, or wraparound straps near the ankle.
   - Make sure the wearer can easily put them on and take them off.

4. TEXTURE:
   - If possible, use a slightly textured sole material.
   - This helps grip the floor without feeling sticky.

PART B — ANKLE BAND

1. BAND SHAPE:
   - Cut a strip of fabric long enough to wrap once or twice around the ankle.
   - Width: about 3–4 cm.

2. SPIRAL LINE:
   - Stitch a gentle spiral or wave line along the band.
   - This line symbolizes the flow of energy around the ankle.

3. CLOSURE:
   - Add ties or a soft fastening method (Velcro, button, loop).
   - Ensure the band sits comfortably above the ankle bones.

USE:
- Grounding exercises (standing, swaying, shifting weight).
- Quiet walking or dancing where foot sound is minimized.
- Balance drills (standing on one foot, slow turns, controlled steps).

SAFETY:
- Foot wraps and bands must not cut off circulation.
- The wearer must be able to remove them easily and quickly.
- Use caution on rough outdoor surfaces; these are not hard-sole shoes.

PRINCIPLE:
These are listening tools, not armor.
They help the feet and ankles remember how to speak kindly with the ground.
