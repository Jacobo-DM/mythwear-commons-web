WRIST–ELBOW BAND PATTERN — FORCE PATH TRAINER
Commons Blueprint v1.0

PURPOSE
A simple band that maps the path from wrist to elbow,
teaching how force, tension, and attention travel along the forearm.
Designed for Rage Dance, martial arts, and movement medicine.

MATERIALS
- Sturdy but soft fabric strip (old t-shirt, leggings, or wrap)
  Length: from wrist crease to just below elbow, plus overlap for closure.
  Width: 5–8 cm (2–3 inches), depending on arm size.
- Optional inner layer for cushioning
- Thread, needles, scissors
- Optional:
  • Contrasting thread for “force path” line
  • Small knots, beads, or bumps to mark key points
  • Simple closure (ties, snaps, or hook-and-loop)

CORE FORM
1. Measure:
   - Measure from wrist crease to just below elbow.
   - Add 4–6 cm (about 2 inches) for overlap.

2. Cut:
   - Cut a rectangle to that length.
   - Round the corners so nothing digs into the skin.

3. Close the Band:
   - You can:
     • Sew into a loop that slides over the hand, or
     • Leave it as a wrap with a closure at the outer forearm.
   - Place any closure away from the inner wrist so it doesn’t irritate.

FORCE PATH MAPPING
1. Draw the Line:
   - With fabric flat, draw a curve from wrist area to elbow end:
     • Inner edge = more sensitive, subtle line
     • Outer edge = more impact, stronger line
   - This line is the “force path.”

2. Stitch or Mark:
   - Stitch along this line with contrasting thread, or
   - Apply braid/cord, or
   - Use fabric paint or permanent marker.

3. Landmarks:
   - Add small knots, beads, or stitches at:
     • Wrist flexor area (closer to palm side)
     • Mid-forearm
     • Just below elbow
   - These become “checkpoints” of awareness.

MOVEMENT INVITATIONS
- Ask:
  • “Can you send a gentle wave from wrist to elbow along this path?”
  • “What changes when the palm is up vs. down?”
  • “Can you keep attention along the band during a punch, push, or reach?”
- For Rage Dance:
  • Use slow, spiraling movements first.
  • Then faster strikes or blocks, still tracking the path.

PAIRING
- Works well paired with:
  • Leaf Circuit on hoodie or shirt
  • Tabi + ankle bands
  • Simple breath cues: inhale from wrist to elbow, exhale back down.

ACCESSIBILITY
- Band must not be too tight. You should easily slip a finger under it.
- For very sensitive skin, use the softest layer inside and keep the path line minimal.
