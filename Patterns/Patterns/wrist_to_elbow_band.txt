WRIST–ELBOW BAND PATTERN — FORCE PATH TRAINER
Commons Blueprint v1.0

PURPOSE:
A soft band linking wrist and elbow to teach alignment, awareness of tension,
and the path of force through the arm. Used for Rage Dance foundations and
mindful martial movement.

INTENT:
- Help the wearer feel how movement travels through the arm.
- Encourage softer, more connected motion instead of stiff or disconnected action.
- Serve as a simple feedback tool, not a restraint.

MATERIALS:
- Soft fabric (cotton, jersey, linen) for cuffs and band
- Optional light padding
- Thread and needle
- Optional: small bell or bead for sound feedback

COMPONENTS:
1. WRIST CUFF:
   - A soft band that wraps once around the wrist.
   - Width: about 2–3 cm.
   - Should fit with room for two fingers under the edge.

2. ELBOW CUFF:
   - Sits below the elbow, around the upper forearm.
   - Same width guidelines as the wrist cuff.
   - Also leaves room for two fingers under the edge.

3. CONNECTING BAND:
   - A strip of fabric or cord linking the outer side of wrist cuff
     to the outer side of elbow cuff.
   - Slightly shorter than the distance between wrist and elbow to
     become gently taut at full extension.

CONSTRUCTION STEPS:
1. CUT:
   - Cut two rectangles for cuffs and one longer strip for the band.

2. FORM CUFFS:
   - Sew each rectangle into a loop that fits comfortably around wrist and forearm.
   - Finish edges so they are soft against the skin.

3. ATTACH BAND:
   - Sew one end of the band to the outer side of the wrist cuff.
   - Sew the other end to the outer side of the elbow cuff.
   - Ensure there is a little slack so the band is not tight at rest.

4. OPTIONAL SOUND MARKER:
   - Attach a small bell or bead at the elbow cuff attachment point.
   - This gives gentle sound feedback when movement is sharp or abrupt.

USE:
- Slow arm extensions and retractions to feel when the band becomes taut.
- Explore punching or pushing motions in a safe context, noticing the force path.
- Practice moving so that the band stays soft, using breath and relaxation.

SAFETY:
- The band must never cut off circulation.
- The wearer must be able to remove both cuffs independently.
- This tool is for awareness and learning, not for restraint or control.

PRINCIPLE:
The wrist–elbow band is a reminder, not a command.
It listens to how you move and invites you to move with more kindness and clarity.
