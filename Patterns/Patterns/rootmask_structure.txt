ROOTMASK / ROOTFACE PATTERN — NOPAL LATTICE
Commons Blueprint v1.0

PURPOSE:
A lightweight, breathable mask that feels like being inside a nopal cactus:
warm, shaded, and gently protected, without blocking vision or breath.

INTENT:
- Offer a soft “inside-the-plant” feeling.
- Provide comfort and a sense of shelter.
- Allow free movement, easy removal, and clear sight.

MATERIALS:
- Soft but sturdy fabric (felt, cotton, linen, reclaimed cloth)
- Optional inner lining for warmth or softness
- Narrow strips or cords for the “lattice” (root lines)
- Soft ties or elastic for attaching around the head
- Needle, thread, scissors, chalk or pencil for marking

BASIC SHAPE:
1. FACE OVAL:
   - Draw and cut a gentle oval that sits from mid-forehead to mid-cheek.
   - Leave a large, comfortable opening for the eyes.
   - The mask should not cover the mouth or nose completely.

2. SIDE CUTS:
   - At each temple, mark small slits or attachment points for straps.
   - This is where the RootMask will tie or anchor behind the head.

LATTICE STRUCTURE:
1. CENTER ROOT:
   - From the center between the eyebrows, draw a line upward and slightly outward.
   - This is the “main root” of the mask.

2. BRANCH ROOTS:
   - From this center root, draw curved lines (like plant veins) fanning across the mask.
   - Aim for 5–9 lines total, each one slightly curved and organic, not mechanical.

3. STITCH OR ATTACH:
   - Sew thin cords or fabric strips along these lines.
   - The pattern should feel like a web of roots holding the mask gently together.

BAND / STRAP:
1. HEAD STRAP:
   - Cut a soft band that reaches from one temple around the back of the head to the other temple.
   - Attach securely to the side points of the mask.

2. FIT:
   - The strap should be snug but not tight.
   - The wearer must be able to remove the RootMask quickly on their own.

COMFORT & SAFETY:
- No hard edges or sharp corners.
- Nothing rigid near the eyes.
- All seams that touch skin should be soft and smoothed.

PLAYFUL EXTRAS (OPTIONAL):
- Small bells or beads at some lattice intersections.
- A lightly tinted inner layer to create a soft “plant light.”
- Scented cloth or herbs sewn into small inner pockets (only if safe for the wearer).

USE:
- Quiet time, Mudhead play, sensory regulation, story circles, reflection.
- The RootMask is not for running or high-speed play unless adapted for greater visibility and security.

PRINCIPLE:
RootMask should help the wearer feel rooted, sheltered, and gently held,
never trapped or confined.
