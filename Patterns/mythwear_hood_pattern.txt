MYTHWEAR HOOD PATTERN — ARC–SPINE FORM
Commons Blueprint v1.0

PURPOSE:
A soft, structured hood that creates a grounding arc from the forehead to the tailbone.
Designed for movement medicine, sensory regulation, and gentle warmth.
Inspired by plants that protect without imprisoning.

MATERIALS:
- Soft cotton, hemp, jersey, or fleece (reclaimed preferred)
- Optional inner layer for warmth or weighted grounding
- Braided forehead band or soft jute-style cord
- 3 small anchor loops (forehead center, left temple, right temple)
- Long spine cord from forehead anchor to base of hood
- Thread, needles, scissors

PATTERN STRUCTURE:
1. Cut two mirrored hood panels shaped like an elongated raindrop.
   - Length: from crown of head to shoulders.
   - Width: enough to surround the head comfortably without pressure.

2. Stitch panels together along the curved back seam.

3. At the forehead edge, attach a soft braided band.
   - Place three anchor loops:
     CENTER LOOP: aligned with the midline of the face.
     TEMPLE LOOPS: roughly above each eyebrow.

4. Attach a single spine cord from the center loop.
   - Run the cord along the top seam.
   - Continue it down the back seam to the bottom edge.
   - Secure at three or more points so it follows the spine line.

5. Finish the face opening with a soft rolled hem.

NOTES:
- The hood should feel like entering a soft cave or quiet plant chamber.
- It should warm the forehead and ears without pressure.
- Kids should be able to attach bells, beads, charms, or scents to the loops.

USE:
Movement classes, self-regulation moments, quiet reflection, play.
