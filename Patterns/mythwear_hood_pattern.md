# MythWear Hood · Arc–Spine Pattern  
Commons Blueprint v1.0

## Purpose
A soft, structured hood that creates a grounding arc from the forehead down the spine.  
Designed for movement medicine, sensory regulation, and gentle warmth.  
Inspired by being “inside the cactus” — warm, shielded, but still able to see and breathe.

## Materials
- Soft cotton, hemp, jersey, fleece, or reclaimed cloth
- Optional inner layer for warmth or weighting
- Braided fabric or cord for the forehead band
- Three anchor loops (center, left temple, right temple)
- Long spine cord to follow the seam down the back of the hood
- Needle, thread, scissors, chalk or pencil

## Pattern
1. **Hood shell**  
   - Cut two mirrored hood panels shaped like long raindrops.  
   - Sew them together along the curved back seam.

2. **Face opening**  
   - Trim the front edge so it frames the face comfortably.  
   - Finish with a soft hem or bias strip.

3. **Forehead band**  
   - Create a braided band that rests above the eyebrows.  
   - Stitch it to the inside front edge of the hood.

4. **Three anchor loops**  
   - Add one loop at the center of the forehead.  
   - Add one loop near each temple.  
   - These accept small bells, beads, tags, or scent sachets.

5. **Spine cord**  
   - Stitch a cord from the center loop along the top seam  
     down toward the back of the neck and spine.  
   - This marks the “arc” of the hood in motion.

## Use
- Rage Dance warm-up and cooldown  
- Quiet sensory time in a MudHut or classroom corner  
- Story circles and character play

## Principle
The hood should feel like entering a friendly plant chamber:  
held, warmed, and shielded, never restricted or trapped.
