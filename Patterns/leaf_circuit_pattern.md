# Leaf Circuit · Wearable Nervous System  
Commons Blueprint v1.0

## Purpose
A soft, symbolic “nervous system map” that can be worn or held.  
It helps students trace breath, tension, and emotion through the body  
using the metaphor of a leaf.

## Materials
- Leaf-shaped piece of fabric
- Cord or yarn for central and branching “veins”
- Optional beads or tiny bells at junctions
- Needle, thread, scissors

## Pattern
1. **Leaf base**  
   - Cut a leaf or teardrop shape that fits comfortably on the chest, back, or forearm.

2. **Central vein**  
   - Stitch one strong line down the middle: the “spine” or main nerve.

3. **Branching veins**  
   - From this central line, add curved branches like a leaf.  
   - These represent pathways of breath, energy, or feeling.

4. **Nodes**  
   - At intersections, you may add small beads or bells  
     as points of attention or sound.

## Use
- Trace a path with a fingertip while breathing slowly.  
- Map where in the body a feeling “lands.”  
- Use in pairs to describe sensations without needing big words.

## Principle
The leaf reminds us that a nervous system is alive, growing, and responsive —  
not a machine to be controlled.
