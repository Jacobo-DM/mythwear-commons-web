ROOTMASK / ROOTFACE PATTERN — NOPAL LATTICE
Commons Blueprint v1.0

PURPOSE
A soft, repairable mask or face frame inspired by nopal paddles and root lattices.
It’s meant to offer a sense of protection and focus without imprisoning the face.
Think “garden trellis for attention,” not armor.

MATERIALS
- Soft, breathable fabric (reclaimed cotton, linen, or similar)
- Optional lining for warmth or sensitivity
- Thin bias tape, cord, or soft braid for the “lattice”
- Soft ties or elastic for back-of-head fastening
- Thread, needles, scissors, pins

CORE FORM
1. Base Shape:
   - Cut a soft mask shape that rests lightly over nose and cheeks,
     or a “face frame” that traces the brow, cheekbones, and jaw.
   - Leave plenty of clearance so breathing is easy and nothing presses the nose.

2. Lattice Concept:
   - Imagine the face as a small nopal pad:
     • Horizontal “veins” = calm
     • Vertical “veins” = grounding
     • Diagonal “veins” = directional focus / movement
   - The lattice should remain open. No full coverage, no tight grid.

PATTERN STEPS
1. Draft:
   - Hold a rectangle of fabric to your face and mark:
     • Midline between the eyes
     • Lines along the cheekbones
     • The edge where you want the mask or frame to end.
   - Trim into a gentle, organic shape.

2. Anchor Points:
   - Mark 4–6 anchor points:
     • One at center between the brows
     • One at each temple
     • One at each cheek
     • Optional: one at center of chin or jawline

3. Lattice Lines:
   - From the center brow point, run soft tape or cord:
     • Down the midline toward nose tip (stop above nostrils)
     • Diagonally toward each cheek anchor
   - From each temple anchor:
     • Run a gentle curve toward the cheek anchors
   - From cheek anchors:
     • Optional branch toward jaw or chin anchor

4. Stitching:
   - Stitch tapes/cord down flat so they don’t irritate the skin.
   - Keep the inside as smooth as possible:
     no knots or stiff seams against the face.

5. Ties:
   - Add soft ties or elastic at the sides to secure behind the head.
   - Fit should be snug enough to stay on, loose enough to forget.

INVITATIONS / USE
- Invite the wearer to notice:
  “Where do you feel supported? Where do you feel free?”
- Use the lattice lines to guide breath or attention:
  • “Breathe along the midline.”
  • “Let your attention travel from temple to temple.”
- For classes: let kids decorate anchor points with beads, tiny bells,
  or color-coded stitches representing “calm,” “focus,” “courage,” etc.

ACCESSIBILITY
- Avoid any pressure on nose bridge.
- For sensory-sensitive wearers, keep the design as a *frame* only:
  no fabric over nose and mouth, just the lattice tracing the face.
