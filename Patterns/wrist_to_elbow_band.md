# Wrist–Elbow Band · Force Path Trainer  
Commons Blueprint v1.0

## Purpose
A soft connector between wrist and elbow that teaches alignment and  
the path of force through the arm.  
Used in Rage Dance foundations and mindful martial work.

## Materials
- Soft fabric for two cuffs
- A strip or cord for the connecting band
- Optional small bell or bead
- Needle, thread, scissors

## Pattern
1. **Wrist cuff**  
   - Cut a rectangle to wrap once around the wrist.  
   - Sew into a loop that fits with room for two fingers under the edge.

2. **Elbow cuff**  
   - Cut a larger rectangle for the upper forearm, below the elbow.  
   - Sew into a loop with similar gentle fit.

3. **Connecting band**  
   - Cut a strip linking the outer side of the wrist cuff  
     to the outer side of the elbow cuff.  
   - Attach so it has a little slack at rest and goes gently taut  
     near full extension.

4. **Feedback marker (optional)**  
   - Add a small bell or bead near the elbow attachment  
     so sudden, sharp movements make sound.

## Use
- Slow extensions and retractions of the arm  
- Notice when the band tugs: that is where tension or misalignment hides  
- Practice moving so the band stays soft, supported by breath

## Principle
The band is a reminder, not a restraint.  
It invites curiosity about how force travels through the body.
