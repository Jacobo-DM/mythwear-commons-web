# Tabi & Ankle Band · Grounding Pattern  
Commons Blueprint v1.0

## Purpose
Simple foot and ankle wraps inspired by tabi, for grounding, balance,  
and quiet movement. Useful in Rage Dance and other mindful practices.

## Materials
- Soft but durable fabric (stretch cotton, jersey, or reclaimed cloth)
- Optional thin textured sole layer
- Needle, thread, scissors

## Part A — Tabi Foot Wrap

1. **Sole and upper**  
   - Trace the foot and cut a sole piece.  
   - Cut an upper piece that covers the top of the foot  
     with a split between the big toe and the others.

2. **Join**  
   - Sew upper to sole around the sides and front.  
   - Reinforce the area between big toe and second toe.

3. **Closure**  
   - Add a simple tie or wraparound strap near the ankle.

## Part B — Ankle Band

1. **Band**  
   - Cut a strip long enough to wrap once or twice around the ankle.  
   - Width about 3–4 cm.

2. **Spiral stitch**  
   - Sew a gentle spiral or wave along the band  
     to represent grounding flow.

3. **Fastening**  
   - Add soft ties or Velcro so it can be removed quickly.

## Use
- Balance drills and slow walking  
- Grounding before or after intense movement  
- Practicing quieter, more conscious footfalls

## Principle
These are listening tools, not armor.  
They remind the feet and ankles how to speak kindly with the ground.
